My vim configuration. I put all of this in $HOME/.vim.  I then make a link from
$HOME/.vim/vimrc to $HOME/.vimrc

The rest is pulled from vimrc... It will always have the most up-to-date info,
so check it rather than this README for details and references.

I'm using tpope's pathogen to handle plugins.
Based off of taylor's configs.  

TIPS:
  "*p to paste from system copy buffer
  use ^P/^N in insert mode to complete words
  ^] to jump to tags
  ^W s,^W v - split windows
  gt/gT switching between tabs (or use mappings below)
  f<letter> / t<letter> - jump to next letter or before letter
  gv - highlight last visual
  gg=G - Indent the whole file

  <F5> - Toggle paste mode
